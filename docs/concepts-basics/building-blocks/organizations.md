# Organizations

An _organization_ can contain one or more projects, groups, users, and notifications. Organizations help control access to projects, making it easy to create groups, add and remove users, and assign groups to projects.

Organizations have a quota to limit the number of projects, groups, notifications, and environments that can be assigned to it. If you need to change this quota, please contact your Lagoon administrator.
