# Roles

_Roles_ determine a user's access to projects. Users are given roles in groups and organizations.

Members of groups can be given the following roles:

- Guest
- Reporter
- Developer
- Maintainer
- Owner

These roles and their permissions are described in more depth here: [Role-Based Access Control](../../interacting/rbac.md).

Members of organizations can be given the following roles:

- Org Owner
- Org Viewer

    If you need to change quotas, please contact your Lagoon administrator.

An _org owner_ can do everything to do with administering an organization aside from changing quotas.

An _org viewer_ is a read-only role that can only view the organization, but cannot make any changes or additions.

A user who has not been assigned as an owner or viewer cannot see the organization.
