# Lagoonizing Your Exisiting Site

_Lagoonizing_, or getting your existing site ready for the Lagoon platform, isn't generally difficult (depending on your site and setup), but does have a handful of steps. We've put together a stepo-by-step guide to make this process easier for you.

## Requirements

Make sure your system [meets the requirements](../using-lagoon-the-basics/index.md) for working with Lagoon locally.

## Local Development Environment

[Set up your local development environment](../using-lagoon-the-basics/local-development-environments.md). You can choose between Pygmy and Lando.

## Command Line and Git

You'll need to interact with Lagoon via the command line, and you'll need Git as well, so make sure they're ready to go.

### Command line

You’ll need to use a command line terminal for some tasks. Whatever you want to use is fine, including your operating system default tool. Here are a few options:

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (Mac)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) (Windows)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/) (Mac, Windows, Linux)

### Install Git

If you don’t have one already, you’ll need a Git client of some kind. Command line, GUI, whatever works for you (our examples will use the command line, FYI). Here are a few options:

- [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Mac, Windows)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Mac, Windows)
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) (Mac, Windows, Linux - free for public repositories)
