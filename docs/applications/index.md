# Applications that can be run on Lagoon

Lagoon can support a wide range of applications.

We have (broadly) three levels of support for an application type:

1. Tier 1 - Lagoon has maintained and tested templates, ready for use, built-in configuration.
2. Tier 2 - There are maintained and tested examples available, for use as a guideline.
3. Tier 3 - There are demos available, suitable for use as a guideline.

Of course, we haven't (yet) covered every single application, framework or language.

The complete range of Lagoon templates, examples and demos can be found at [https://github.com/lagoon-examples](https://github.com/lagoon-examples).

Lagoon has a couple of Tier 1 applications - Drupal and WordPress.
