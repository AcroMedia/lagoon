# Node.js

## Introduction

Our [Node.js images](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images/tree/main/images/node) are based on top of [the official Node Alpine images](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

More information on how to adapt your project to run on Lagoon can be found in our [Docker Images section](/docker-images/nodejs).
